# AWS S3 Upload

![pytest](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)
![coverage-badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jethror1/d591ef748f8a2c40c21ceedcad88a80e/raw/covbadge.json)

Uploads Illumina sequencing runs into AWS S3 storage.

There are 2 modes implemented, one to interactively upload a single sequencing run, and another to monitor on a schedule (i.e. via cron) one or more directories for newly completed sequencing runs and automatically upload into a given S3 bucket location.

All behaviour for the monitor mode is controlled by a JSON config file (described [below](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload?tab=readme-ov-file#config)). It is intended to be set up to run on a schedule and monitor one or more directories for newly completed sequencing runs and automatically upload to specified AWS S3 bucket(s) and remote path(s). Multiple local and remote paths may be specified to monitor the output of multiple sequencers. Runs to upload may currently be filtered with regex patterns to match against the samples parsed from the samplesheet, where the sample names are informative of the assay / experiment to be uploaded.

## :desktop_computer: Usage

Uploading a single run:
```
python3 s3_upload/s3_upload.py upload \
    --local_path /path/to/run/to/upload \
    --bucket myBucket
```

Adding to a crontab for hourly monitoring:
```
0 * * * * python3 s3_upload/s3_upload.py monitor --config /path/to/config.json
```


## :page_facing_up: Inputs

Available inputs for `upload`:
* `--local_path` (required): path to sequencing run to upload
* `--bucket` (required): existing S3 bucket with write permission for authenticated user
* `--remote_path` (optional | default: `/`): path in bucket in which to upload the run
* `--skip_check` (optional | default: False): Controls if to skip checks for the provided directory being a completed sequencing run. Setting to false allows for uploading any arbitrary provided directory to AWS S3.
* `--cores` (optional | default: maximum available): total CPU cores to split uploading of files across
* `--threads` (optional | default: 4): total threads to use per CPU core for uploading


Available inputs for `monitor`:
* `--config`: path to JSON config file for monitoring (see Config section below)
* `--dry_run` (optional): calls everything except the actual upload to check what runs would be uploaded


## :gear: Config

The behaviour for monitoring of directories for sequencing runs to upload is controlled through the use of a JSON config file. An example may be found [here](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/example/example_config.json).

The top level keys that may be defined include:
* `max_cores` (`int` | optional): maximum number of CPU cores to split uploading across (default: maximum available)
* `max_threads` (`int` | optional): the maximum number of threads to use per CPU core
* `max_age` (`int` | optional): maximum age in hours of a complete run to monitor for upload, determined from mtime of `RunInfo.xml` (default: 72h). For example, setting `max_age: 48` will only upload runs created (or `RunInfo.xml` modified) within the last 48 hours.
* `log_level` (`str` | optional): the level of logging to set, available options are defined [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels)
* `log_dir` (`str` | optional): path to where to store logs (default: `/var/log/s3_upload`)
* `slack_log_webhook` (`str` | optional): Slack webhook URL to use for sending notifications on successful uploads, will try use `slack_alert_webhook` if not specified (see [Slack](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload?tab=readme-ov-file#slack) below for details).
* `slack_alert_webhook` (`str` | optional): Slack webhook URL to use for sending notifications on failed uploads, will try use `slack_log_webhook` if not specified (see [Slack](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload?tab=readme-ov-file#slack) below for details).


Monitoring of specified directories for sequencing runs to upload are defined in a list of dictionaries under the `monitor` key. The available keys per monitor dictionary include:
* `monitored_directories` (`list` | required): list of absolute paths to directories to monitor for new sequencing runs (i.e the location the sequencer outputs to)
* `bucket` (`str` | required): name of S3 bucket to upload to
* `remote_path` (`str` | required): parent path in which to upload sequencing run directories in the specified bucket
* `sample_regex` (`str` | optional): regex pattern to match against all samples parsed from the samplesheet, all samples must match this pattern to upload the run. This is to be used for controlling upload of specific runs where samplenames inform the assay / test.
* `exclude_patterns` (`list` | optional): list of directory / filename regex patterns of which to exclude from uploading (e.g. `[".*png"]` would exclude the PNGs from `Thumbnail_Images/` from being uploaded)

Each dictionary inside of the list to monitor allows for setting separate upload locations for each of the monitored directories. For example, in the below codeblock the output of both `sequencer_1` and `sequencer_2` would be uploaded to the root of `bucket_A`, and the output of `sequencer_3` would be uploaded into `sequencer_3_runs` in `bucket_B`. Any number of these dictionaries may be defined in the monitor list.

```
    "monitor": [
        {
            "monitored_directories": [
                "/absolute/path/to/sequencer_1",
                "/absolute/path/to/sequencer_2"
            ],
            "bucket": "bucket_A",
            "remote_path": "/",
            "sample_regex": "_assay_1_code_|_assay_code_2_"
        },
        {
            "monitored_directories": [
                "/absolute/path/to/sequencer_3"
            ],
            "bucket": "bucket_B",
            "remote_path": "/sequencer_3_runs",
            "exclude_patterns": [
                "Config/",
                ".*png"
            ]
        }
    ]
```
*Example `monitor` config section defining two sets of monitored directories and upload locations*


## :closed_lock_with_key: AWS Authentication

Authentication with AWS may be performed either via SSO / IAM or with specified access keys. If using SSO / IAM, it must first be configured using the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso), and then the profile being used set to the environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`. If this is specified the uploader will attempt to authenticate using this profile which must have permission to access the specified S3 bucket. If using access keys, both the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` must be set, and these will be used for authentication. If running via the provided Docker image these may be set using `--env` or `--env-file`.

Only one authentication method may be used, if both `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SECRET_KEY` are provided the uploader will exit and one method must be unset to continue.


## :wood: Logging

All logs by default are written to `/var/log/s3_upload`. Logs from stdout and stderr are written to the file `s3_upload.log.{YYYY-MM-DD}`, with all logs from an invocation of the upload being written to that day's log (i.e if the upload begins at 11.59pm, all logs from that upload would be written to that day's file and not roll over to the next). Backups are rotated and stored in the same directory for 5 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Write permission is required to the default or specified log directory, if not a `PermissionError` will be raised on checking the log directory permissions.

A JSON log file is written per sequencing run to upload that is stored in a `uploads/` subdirectory of the main log directory. Each of these log files is used to store the state of the upload (i.e if it has completed or only partially uploaded), and what files have been uploaded along with the S3 "ETag" ID. This log file is used when searching for sequencing runs to upload. Any runs with a log file containing `"completed": true` will be skipped and not reuploaded, and those with a log file containing `"completed": false` indicates a run that previously did not complete uploading and will be added to the upload list.

The expected fields in this log file are:

* `run_id` (`str`) - the ID of the run (i.e. the name of the run directory)
* `run_path` (`str`) - the absolute path to the run directory being uploaded
* `completed` (`bool`) - the state of the run upload
* `total_local_files` (`int`) - the total number of files in the run expected to upload
* `total_uploaded_files` (`int`) - the total number of files that have been successfully uploaded
* `total_failed_upload` (`int`) - the total number of files that failed to upload in the most recent upload attempt
* `failed_upload_files` (`list`) - list of filepaths of files that failed to upload
* `uploaded_files` (`dict`) - mapping of filename to ETag ID of successfully uploaded files


## :dash: Benchmarks
A small [benchmarking script](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/scripts/benchmark.py) has been written to be able to repeatedly call the uploader with a set number of cores and threads at once to determine the optimal setting for upload time and available compute. It will iterate through combinations of the provided cores and threads, uploading a given run directory and automatically deleting the uploaded files on completion. Results are then written to a file `s3_upload_benchmark_{datetime}.tsv` in the current directory. This allows for measuring the total upload time and maximum resident set size (i.e. peak memory usage). This is using the [memory-profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) package to measure combined memory usage of all spawned child processes to run the upload.

The below benchmarks were output from running the script with the following arguments: `python3 scripts/benchmark.py --local_path /genetics/A01295b/241023_A01295_0432_BHK3NFDRX5 --cores 1 2 4 --threads 1 2 4 8 --bucket s3-upload-benchmarking`.

These benchmarks were obtained from uploading a NovaSeq S1 flowcell sequencing run compromising of 102GB of data in 5492 files. Uploading was done on a virtual server with a 4 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz vCPU, 16GB RAM and 10Gbit/s network bandwidth. Uploading will be highly dependent on network bandwidth availability, local storage speed, available compute resources etc. Upload time *should* scale approximately linearly with the total files / size of run. YMMV.

## <img src="images/moby.png" width="34"/> Docker

A Dockerfile is provided for running the upload from within a Docker container. For convenience, the tool is aliased to the command `s3_upload` in the container.

To build the Docker image: `docker build -t s3_upload:<tag> .`.

To run the Docker image:
```
$ docker run --rm s3_upload:1.0.0 s3_upload upload --help
usage: s3_upload.py upload [-h] [--local_path LOCAL_PATH] [--bucket BUCKET]
                           [--remote_path REMOTE_PATH] [--cores CORES]
                           [--threads THREADS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --local_path LOCAL_PATH
                        path to directory to upload
  --bucket BUCKET       S3 bucket to upload to
  --remote_path REMOTE_PATH
                        remote path in bucket to upload sequencing dir to
  --cores CORES         number of CPU cores to split total files to upload
                        across, will default to using all available
  --threads THREADS     number of threads to open per core to split uploading
                        across (default: 8)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both the `--local_path` for single run upload, and `monitored_directories` paths for monitoring, must be relative to where they are mounted into the container (i.e. if you mount the sequencer output to `/sequencer_output/` then your paths would be `--local_path /sequencer_output/run_A/` and `/sequencer_output/` for single upload and monitoring, respectively). In addition, for monitoring you must ensure to mount the log directory outside of the container to be persistent (i.e. using the default log location: `--volume /local/log/dir:/var/log/s3_upload`. If this is not done when the container shuts down, all runs will be identified as new on the next upload run and will attempt to be uploaded).

> [!TIP]
> * The required environment variables for [AWS authentication](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#closed_lock_with_key-aws-authentication) can be provided with either `--env-file` as a file or individually with `--env`
>
> * When running in monitor mode, the config file may be mounted with `--volume /local/path/to/config.json:/app/config.json` and then passed as an argument as `--config /app/config.json`


## <img src="images/slack.png" width="22"/> Slack

Currently, notifications are able to be sent via the use of Slack webhooks. These include log notifications for when run(s) complete uploading, as well as alerts for if upload(s) fail, or if authentication to AWS fails. Use of Slack notifications is optional, and all alerts will still go to the log file by default if not configured.

To enable Slack notifications, one or both of the keys `slack_log_webhook` and `slack_alert_webhook` should be added to the config file. If both are defined, notifications of complete uploads will be sent to `slack_log_webhook` and any errors / failures will be sent to `slack_alert_webhook`. If only one is defined, all notifications will be sent to that single endpoint.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Tests

Comprehensive unit tests have been written in [tests/unit](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/tree/main/tests/unit) for all the core functionality of the uploader. These are configured to run with PyTest on every change with [GitHub actions](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/.github/workflows/pytest.yml).

Several [end to end test scenarios](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/tree/main/tests/e2e) have also been written to provide robust and automated end to end testing. These are currently not configured to run via GitHub actions due to requiring authentication with AWS. Details on running the tests may be found in the [e2e test readme](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). These should be run locally when changes are made and updated accordingly.


## :pen: Notes
* When running in monitor mode, a file lock is acquired on `s3_upload.lock`, which by default will be written into the log directory. This ensures only a single upload process may run at once, preventing duplicate concurrent uploads of the same files.
  * When running via Docker, you must ensure that the `--rm` flag is provided to `docker run` to ensure the container is automatically removed on exit. If not, the exited container may still hold a file lock on the lock file, preventing subsequent calls to the uploader.
* To prompt a run older than `max_age` as defined from the config file to be uploaded, the `mtime` of the `RunInfo.xml` can be updated with `touch /path/to/run_dir/RunInfo.xml`


## :hook: Pre-commit Hooks
For development, pre-commit hooks are setup to enable secret scanning using [Yelp/detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets?tab=readme-ov-file), this will attempt to prevent accidentally committing anything that may be sensitive (i.e. AWS credentials).

This requires first installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), both may be installed with pip:
```
pip install pre-commit detect-secrets
```

The config for the pre-commit hook is stored in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/.secrets.baseline) and the baseline for the repository to compare against when scanning with detect-secrets is stored in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/eastgenomics/s3_upload/blob/main/.secrets.baseline)

**The pre-commit hook must then be installed to run on each commit**:
```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
